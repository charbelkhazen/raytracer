used:
variadic functions (stderr)
modular code (should I .a for each module ?)
design by contract
refactored libft 
no io or allocation in module - clients responsability
cool trick with std_assert : when using a function macro , input can be both interpret as string and as int 
leverage actual mechanics of post and pre inc/decrement : ATOD is a good exercise (uses precedence and post increment subtle tricks)
use union+enum: best solution to keep lifetime of t_obj coherent (all other methods fail to stay coherent with general logic (i.e .casting or using ptrs))
