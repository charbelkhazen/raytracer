need to add a new struct containing : light + universe . param_struct

- make AMBIENT LIGHT pass from main to lambertphong

- CAN USE LIGHT COLOR -> in lambert and phong I : which used to be double 0,1 will now be a vector (rgb) 

- UNDERSTAND PLANE IN SUBJECT

- is it possible to make it faster using multithreading


1 - from user to camera.c 
2 - make camera flip (i.e. vup , lookfrom , lookat...)


-> refactor camera :
	color function needs to be in render module 
	img and view seperate modules
	see what you can with geom ( can you make it opaque ? consider isolating it only as a last resort option)




create an alias for TODO!!!


IMPORTANT SHELL
understand the alias command (specially the &(data + thing %h ....))
alias note='echo "- [ ] $(date "+%F %T") — " >> TODO.md'
can you build your own command without using alias (thinking of env vars) : e.g. grep -r "//TODO:" can it be summarized by an env var that I would call?
IMPORTANT SHELL



test code with improbable values: e.g. diameter = 0 for sphere




YOU CAN FIND INCOMPLEETE PROMPT THAT ODES THIS , BUT I PREFER DOING IT AFTER I HAVE BUILT A SOLID MODEL WITHTOUT CYLINDER AND PLANES and USING DIFFERENT MATERIALS
PLANE AND CYLINDER PARSING USING CHATGPT
give llm :
- rule for sphere and how it was implemented (without the first character) 
- same for camera
- give the interface 
- tell here about the syntax to respect for plane and cylinder( ! dont forget the optional parts to it)
- generate using same logic




!!!!!//TODO:  Make it explicit that some of the parsers (e.g. parse light and camera ...) do take into consideration whitespace OR REMOVE THE WHITESPACE AND DELEGATE IT TO PARSELINE


REFACTORING: 
SEE ALL DEPENDENCIES WRT TO:

material
object
matte






!!!  obj_fillObj in main is clearly WRONG!!



!! consider passing by reference when you can as to not create copies (duplicates)



review : parse.c -> objfill should be reconsidered


review every implementation and see if it takes t_univ , t_obj....




int	lp_attenuationFactor(t_ray ray_to_light, t_univ univ);
void	lp_shade(t_vec *color, t_hitRec rec, t_light light, t_univ univ, t_ray ray);
int	univ_addObj(t_univ *univ, t_obj obj);
int	univ_hit(t_ray ray, t_univ univ, t_hitRec *rec); //does it make sense to have rec as input here -> review where exactly is rec used. see render

(need to implement a hit object : hit sphere is done, hit universe too)



universe -> univ_hit univ should be a pointer : CHANGE THIS
