need to add a new struct containing : light + universe . param_struct

- make AMBIENT LIGHT pass from main to lambertphong

- CAN USE LIGHT COLOR -> in lambert and phong I : which used to be double 0,1 will now be a vector (rgb) 

- UNDERSTAND PLANE IN SUBJECT

- is it possible to make it faster using multithreading


1 - from user to camera.c 
2 - make camera flip (i.e. vup , lookfrom , lookat...)


-> refactor camera :
	color function needs to be in render module 
	img and view seperate modules
	see what you can with geom ( can you make it opaque ? consider isolating it only as a last resort option)




create an alias for TODO!!!


IMPORTANT SHELL
understand the alias command (specially the &(data + thing %h ....))
alias note='echo "- [ ] $(date "+%F %T") — " >> TODO.md'
can you build your own command without using alias (thinking of env vars) : e.g. grep -r "//TODO:" can it be summarized by an env var that I would call?
