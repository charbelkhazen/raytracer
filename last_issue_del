need to add a new struct containing : light + universe . param_struct

- make AMBIENT LIGHT pass from main to lambertphong

- CAN USE LIGHT COLOR -> in lambert and phong I : which used to be double 0,1 will now be a vector (rgb) 

- UNDERSTAND PLANE IN SUBJECT

- is it possible to make it faster using multithreading


1 - from user to camera.c 
2 - make camera flip (i.e. vup , lookfrom , lookat...)


-> refactor camera :
	color function needs to be in render module 
	img and view seperate modules
	see what you can with geom ( can you make it opaque ? consider isolating it only as a last resort option)




create an alias for TODO!!!


IMPORTANT SHELL
understand the alias command (specially the &(data + thing %h ....))
alias note='echo "- [ ] $(date "+%F %T") — " >> TODO.md'
can you build your own command without using alias (thinking of env vars) : e.g. grep -r "//TODO:" can it be summarized by an env var that I would call?
IMPORTANT SHELL



test code with improbable values: e.g. diameter = 0 for sphere




YOU CAN FIND INCOMPLEETE PROMPT THAT ODES THIS , BUT I PREFER DOING IT AFTER I HAVE BUILT A SOLID MODEL WITHTOUT CYLINDER AND PLANES and USING DIFFERENT MATERIALS
PLANE AND CYLINDER PARSING USING CHATGPT
give llm :
- rule for sphere and how it was implemented (without the first character) 
- same for camera
- give the interface 
- tell here about the syntax to respect for plane and cylinder( ! dont forget the optional parts to it)
- generate using same logic




!!!!!//TODO:  Make it explicit that some of the parsers (e.g. parse light and camera ...) do take into consideration whitespace OR REMOVE THE WHITESPACE AND DELEGATE IT TO PARSELINE


REFACTORING: 
SEE ALL DEPENDENCIES WRT TO:

material
object
matte






!!!  obj_fillObj in main is clearly WRONG!!



!! consider passing by reference when you can as to not create copies (duplicates)


review : parse.c -> objfill should be reconsidered



clear issue with ambient light implementation: IT IS WRONG!!!!


!!!! IMPORTANT REFACTORING PROJECT!!!!
I may need to refactor hitRec to include a pointer to the object it is pointing to:
this makes the lambertphong code less hard coded (access object's exact property rather than hard coded values. e.g. access gold's roughness from material's property not always roughness = 0.5)
I WILL DELAY THIS BCZ HAVING MATERIAL PROPERTIES ALSO REQUIRES HAVING A MORE ELABORATE PARSING) 
NOTE: 
YOU WILL NEED TO ADD BACK THE removed the roughness and albedo elements in gold and steel structs
PARSE THESE ELEMENTS 
FIX REC TO HAVE AN OBJ POINTER
NOW IN LAMBERT PHONG INSTEAD OF DEFINING THE ALBEDO AND THE ROUGHNES, USE THE CORRESPONDIN ONES
(NOTE: YOU USE REC IN LAMBERTPHONG ESSENTIALY, LAMBERT PHONG DOESNT CARE ABOUT SHAPE ONLY MATERIAL, THIS IS WHY IN RT IN ONE WEEKEND HE DOESNT POINT TO THE OBJ IN REC, BECAUSE HE USES ONE MATERIAL)
!!


!! instead of working with gold and steel , choose one metallic effect -> realistic aluminum / silver 
!! implement iridescent
