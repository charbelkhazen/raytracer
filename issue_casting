I would like to define a material independtly of shape
so that material would be assigned to more than one shape 
e.g. matte blue to cyclinder and to sphere and metalic green to sphere and plane

-> t_mat and t_shape objects 

I cannot use casting method for inheritence

bcz ill end up with something like this

typedef struct s_obj
{
  int obj_shape;
  int obj_material;
} t_obj;

while:

typedef struct s_sphere
{
  int obj_type;
  t_vec center;
  double radius
} t_sphere;

here t_sphere does not contain int obj_material -> its pointer cannot be correctly casted to obj
